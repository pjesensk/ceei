Wind
Most (63%) of on-shore wind jobs are low-qualified, and STEM jobs account for only 27% of on-shore and
22% of off-shore wind jobs (IRENA, 2021).
Women represent 21% of the
sector workforce according to a gender survey done by IRENA in the wind energy sector, well below the
32% share of women in the workforce for all renewables

Women have a low representation in senior positions in wind companies (8%), with only 13% in
managerial positions. They are mostly present in administrative jobs (35%), followed by non-STEM
positions (20%) and STEM positions (28%).

Hydro
Most direct jobs are in manufacturing. Globally, two-thirds of direct jobs were in manufacturing, 30%
were related to construction and installation activities, and about 6% were in O&M services. 94% of the
current workforce is dedicated to the manufacturing and construction of large government-backed dams
At 25%, the share of women in hydropower is better than in wind but is lower than in the RE sector
overall,
Among women employed in hydropower, only 21% occupy technical and engineering roles, with the
majority, comprising 79%, engaged in non-technical positions, such as administration, commerce,
sales, marketing, human resources, and finance. Results from the ESMAP survey highlight the persistent
underrepresentation of women at mid-level and senior management levels within hydropower companies,
as well as on boards of directors, with women comprising only 29%, 24%, and 19%

Bioenergy
In the corn ethanol industry in the USA, women make up approximately 28% of the workforce, as
reported by the US Department of Energy's 2023 Energy and Employment Report. While this surpasses
the overall gender representation in the energy workforce, which averages 22% in the USA, it still falls short
of the national workforce average of 47%. The workforce in woody biomass and cellulosic biofuels tends
to be more gender diverse, with 30% of workers being female
